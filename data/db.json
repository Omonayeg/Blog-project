A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk,\nand a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing\nbut love.\nWhen I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired pup\nfor fifty cents. He was the light and joy of my childhood. Every afternoon\nabout four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his beautiful eyes\nstaring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he heard my voice or saw me\nswinging my dinner pail through the buck brush, he was off like a shot,\nracing breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and barks of\nsheer ecstasy.\nTippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic\nnight – I shall never forget it – he was killed within ten feet of my head,\nkilled by lightning. Tippy’s death was the tragedy of my boyhood.\nYou never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn’t need to. You\nknew by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in two\nmonths by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in\ntwo years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let me repeat that.\nYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other\npeople than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in\nyou",

She didn’t realise what everyone knows: namely, that the\nexpression one wears on one’s face is far more important than the clothes\none wears on one’s back.\nCharles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a million dollars.\nAnd he was probably understating the truth. For Schwab’s personality, his\ncharm, his ability to make people like him, were almost wholly responsible\nfor his extraordinary success; and one of the most delightful factors in his\npersonality was his captivating smile.\nActions speak louder than words, and a smile says, ‘I like you.
